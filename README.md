### Welcome to the BRCA Exchange Help Pages

Making the decision to get a genetic test for BRCA can be intimidating. Sometimes, there big decisions to make after receiving the results. Upon getting your results, might feel like you have to go in for surgery as soon as possible. However, with more biological information, many realize that genetic tests provide a lot of insight, and there are a variety of treatment options available depending on your results.

The complicated words, letters, numbers, and concepts contained in genetic test results are enough to confuse anyone. Perhaps you are overwhelmed, and feel like the biology is just too complicated for you to ever understand. Well, in these help pages, BRCA Exchange would like to present key ideas in an accessible way, so that you can make informed decisions about your health with your doctor. Although all this genetics stuff can be very complex, we think people are entitled to basic information and education about genetic testing and data gathering.

These help pages will help educate you not only on what BRCA Exchange does as a scientific project, but also on what genetic tests, genomics, and cutting edge technologies are contributing to your BRCA-related health care.
