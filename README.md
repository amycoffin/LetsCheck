### Welcome to the BRCA Exchange Help Pages

Making the decision to get a genetic test can be intimidating. In these help pages, BRCA Exchange would like to present key ideas in an accessible way, so that you can make informed decisions about your health with your doctor. We want to not only explain the BRCA Exchange project, but also help you better understand your BRCA genetic test results and the biology behind them.
