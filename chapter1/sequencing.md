## Chromosomes and their Genes are Sequenced

Chromosomes are made up of DNA. As you might already know, DNA is a molecule built from 4 nucleotide base pairs \(bp\), which are represented as ‘A’, ‘T’,‘C’, and ‘G’ in datasets.

Each of your chromosome pairs has its own unique sequence of these nucleotides. Genes are particular patterns of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that are instructions for the cell to {make particular proteins.} Genes vary in length  \(~85,000 bp in the case of BRCA2; ~115 million bp in the case of chromosome 13\) and make up a small part of their chromosome’s much, much longer sequence. Your chromosomes contain all of your genes, as well as extra DNA that does not code for proteins. All of this DNA together is called the &lt;genome&gt;.

The particular order, or spelling, of base pairs make each of your chromosomes and each gene different from one another. Reading the order of these base pairs, and representing them in a digital format, is called &lt;genomic sequencing.&gt; This is what a very small portion of a huge genetic sequence looks like, spelled using A, T, C, and G:

You might think of this process like taking one of those chromosome “books” a parent gave you, and scanning every single page so that you have a digital copy. Once scientists have a digital copy of your chromosome’s nucleotide sequences, they can use computer software to analyze its contents.

The Human Genome Project created the first digital copy of a human genome. That is, it was a sequenced, digital copy of 23 sample pairs of chromosomes and their genes. This copy was an &lt;average&gt; of the available sequences at the time. The “average” is referred to as the &lt;reference sequence.&gt;The reference sequence is created using many, many peoples’ sequenced genomes, and serves as a sample set for what human genomes tend to look like.

Even though each human has over 3 billion base pairs in each of their cells, these sequences are 99.5% similar. Therefore, while the reference sequence doesn’t perfectly represent all humans, it allows scientists to record how a person differs from the expected average. By sequencing a person's genome, scientists and doctors can track genomic differences. This is done using the individual’s 'variants,' which are shown on the report provided by a genetic testing company. Having this reference, and interpreting information about variants found in humans, is an efficient way of understanding our genetic makeup.

Now that you have an idea of sequencing, we can look at how these [genes turn into proteins](/biology-inheritance-and-sequencing/your-genes-have-exons-that-code-for-proteins.md). Proteins, which cells make by ‘reading’ a gene, can also be sequenced. Because proteins are chains of &lt;amino acids&gt;, a digital protein sequence records and references amino acids \(which look like ‘Ile’, ‘Phe,’ etc.\), rather than nucleotides \(‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’, ‘G’\).
