## Chromosomes and their Genes are Sequenced

Chromosomes are made up of DNA. Four subunits, which are called nucleotides, are repeated in long, unique sequences, and make up the large DNA molecule. When we ‘read’ DNA sequences, these nucleotide building blocks are represented as ‘A’, ‘T’,‘C’, and ‘G’ so that scientists and their computers can analyze DNA data more easily.

Each of your chromosome pairs has its own unique sequence of nucleotides. Genes are regions on the chromosome: their particular spellings of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs are the [instructions for your cells to make proteins](/chapter1/proteins.md). The particular order, or spelling, of base pairs make each of your chromosomes and each of your genes different from one another. Reading the order of these base pairs, and representing them in a digital format, is called &lt;genomic sequencing.&gt; This is what a very small portion of a huge genetic sequence looks like, spelled using A, T, C, and G:

When all of a cell’s chromosomes have been ‘read’ in terms of ‘A’s, ‘T’s, ‘C’s, and ‘G’s, an entire **genome** has been **sequenced**. Every cell contains a copy of the DNA, so when one cell in an organism has its DNA sequenced, we have a pretty reliable copy of every other cell’s DNA. Thus, a **genome** is all of the DNA information an organism has available, in every cell. Not all of your DNA contains genes, though. Relatively small portions of your DNA has specific gene regions that serve as protein instructions. The rest of the DNA mostly does nothing, but can also assist the cell in following the correct gene instructions.

The process of ‘reading’, or sequencing, DNA is like taking those [chromosome “books” you inherited from your parent](/chapter1/subtab.md), and scanning every single page so that you have a digital copy. Then, you can store and read the digital copy through different devices. Similarly, once scientists have a digital copy of your chromosome’s nucleotide sequences, they can use computer software to analyze its contents. Most often, with genetic tests, instead of ‘scanning’ all of your chromosomes and all of their genes, scientists only sequence the chromosomes and genes that are relevant to known health risks.

Genomic sequencing is a somewhat recent development. In 2001, the Human Genome Project created the first digital copy of a complete human genome. Since then, a **reference sequence** has been created using many, many peoples’ sequenced genomes, and serves as an _average_ representation of what human genomes look like. Because DNA sequences are 99.5% similar across the entire human population, the reference sequence actually represents a good portion of your DNA. However, many of your unique biological traits can be attributed to that .5% of your DNA that differs from the reference.

Rather than storing all of your genomic data, a genetic test focuses mainly on how your DNA varies from the reference. If a gene in the reference sequence were to be a word, a genetic test indicates where the gene is ‘spelled’ differently. Accordingly, a genetic test provides your **variants**, which implicate what is different in a tested gene, and where the difference is in the sequence. Two people who are unrelated might end up with the same variant, depending on how common it is. If two people who have the same variant both end up with breast cancer, this might help scientists determine whether this variant is potentially harmful.

Sometimes, a genetic test reveals a variant that has been well documented by scientists, and can be associated with higher risk of a disease. Other times, someone might have a variant that is known to not affect the risk of disease. Most often, we need a lot more information about a variant; thus it is not known whether many variants definitively increase risk of cancers.

Now that you have an idea of sequencing, we can look at how these [genes turn into proteins](/chapter1/proteins.md). Proteins, which cells make by ‘reading’ a gene, can also be sequenced. Because proteins are chains of **amino acids**, a digitized protein sequence records and references amino acids \(which look like ‘Ile’, ‘Phe,’ etc.\), rather than nucleotides.
